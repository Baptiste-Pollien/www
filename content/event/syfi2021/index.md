Title: "Verifying the Mathematical Library of a UAV Autopilot with Frama-C"
event: "SYFI Workshop 2021"
location: "Banyuls" 
abstract: "During the development of a critical system, such as a drone
autopilot, it is essential to ensure that the program is safe, for example
using formal methods. To facilitate verification, we generally restrict
ourselves to an abstraction of the system or a subset. This article presents
the verification of a mathematical library of the Paparazzi autopilot,
using the Frama-C tool, in order to guarantee the absence of runtime
errors and certain functional properties."
