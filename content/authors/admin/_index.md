I am a PhD student at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/), in Toulouse. My thesis deals with formal methods applied on UAV autopilot, especially [Paparazzi](https://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Main_Page) autopilot developed at [ENAC](https://www.enac.fr/). I am currently working on the verification of a mathematical library of Paparazzi using [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/) with [EVA](https://frama-c.com/fc-plugins/eva.html) and [WP](https://frama-c.com/fc-plugins/wp.html) plugins. I am focusing on the verification of the absence of runtime errors (overflows, divisions by 0...)  but I also verify some functional properties.
